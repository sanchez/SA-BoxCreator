    Box Creator
</h3>

This is a Speckle Automate Function for quickly and easily creating a Speckle Box object based on a supplied `height`, `width`, and `depth`. To use this function attach it to a Speckle Model where the Model input is a type of `Base` and has the properties `height`, `width`, and `depth`. The function input `TargetModelName` is then used to specify the Model you want the Box to be uploaded to.
